title: Find date for the nth day of a month in Power BI
date: September 26, 2021

How to use Power Query to find the date for the nth day of a month/year based on another date column (e.g. 3rd Tuesday of October 2021).

In Power BI this can be used for the conditional logic of other Custom Columns. For example, to create indicators that data rows occur on or fall between relative date ranges (e.g. Black Friday sales). The following involves adding a Custom Column in Power Query i.e. M code, not DAX.

This finds the first Monday of the month, where our dependent date column is OurDateField.

```
Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/" & Text.From((7 - (Date.DayOfWeek(Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1"),Day.Monday)))))
```

**How it works**

To find the first Sunday of a specific month/year relative to another date, first establish the start of the month e.g. 1/10 (1st October), passing in the date field you are using e.g. [OurDateField], to append its year.

```
Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1")
```

In this example, we are hard-coding October regardless of OurDateField’s month value, but if you need it to be relative to its month too, simply add an extra concatenation for month in the same way year is treated, i.e. using Date.Month().

Now we need to identify what day of the week that this first day of the month is, using Date.DayOfWeek, and setting the optional parameter for what the start of the week is, as Day.Monday

```
Date.DayOfWeek(Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1"),Day.Monday)
```

In this example, 1st October 2021 is a Friday, and Friday’s day number is 4 (with Monday being 0).

If you do not provide the Day.Monday parameter, it will default to Day.Monday in the background. If another parameter is used e.g. Day.Sunday, then the assignment numbers will change.

Now we subtract the weekday number 4 from 7, and get 3, which is the first Sunday’s date.

```
7 - (Date.DayOfWeek(Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1"),Day.Monday))
```

Then concatenate this with the year month retrieved earlier

```
Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/" & Text.From((7 - (Date.DayOfWeek(Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1"),Day.Monday)))))
```

If you need to change the weekday that Power Query needs to find, simply increment the Day.Monday parameter to the following day of the desired weekday.

For example, if you want to find the first Wednesday, change the parameter to Day.Thursday.

```
Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/" & Text.From((7 - (Date.DayOfWeek(Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1"),Day.Thursday)))))
```

If you need to change the position from first, to second, third, or fourth Sunday, simply add 7 for the second, 14 for the third, and 21 for the fourth.

For example, we will retrieve the 3rd Sunday.

```
Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/" & Text.From((7 - (Date.DayOfWeek(Date.FromText(Text.From(Date.Year([OurDateField])) & "/10/1"),Day.Monday)) + 14 )))
```
