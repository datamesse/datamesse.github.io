When creating web crawlers and scrapers, there is a risk that the IP address of the machine they are running from will be blocked from future scraping attempts. One way around this is creating temporary virtual machines that are assigned new IP addresses to perform the task each time. In this post, we will be creating a Windows Server 2019 instance with Visual Studio Code and Python inside an AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2 instance.

**Note:** Whilst there are time-limited free AWS accounts and services available, I am approaching this from a pay-as-you go perspective, mostly because my free trial period is over.


## Step 1. Create an AWS account and a separate IAM user, then log into your IAM user account

When you first sign up for AWS, you are creating a Root User account, and for security reasons it is best practice to avoid logging into that account as much as possible.

In this case, you would be logged into the Root User just to create an IAM User, and from there use the IAM User login for subsequent work.

First, from the Root User's *Account* menu, ensure that the *IAM User and Role Access to Billing Information* is enabled so that you can keep track of costs withut having to log into the Root User account.

Navigate to the IAM service.

Create a User Group with *AdministratorAccess* to the AWS resources.

Then add a new User to that Group.

Log out of the Root User account, then log in using the IAM User account you created.

## Step 2. Create a Windows 2019 virtual machine

Navigate to the EC2 service, and launch a new Instance, selecting configuration settings based on your own cost implications. The reason why I am using a Windows machine rather than a Linux distribution is because I would need to install an SSH client to log into the GUI for the latter, whereas for a Windows virtual machine, I can just use Windows' Remote Desktop Connection.

![AWS EC2 Service](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2022-08-06--06.png?raw=true)

As an example, these are the settings I chose.

![AWS EC2 Instance set up Part 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2022-08-06--07.png?raw=true)

When you reach the step to create a *Key pair*, you will be prompted to download a .pem file, which will be used to dencrypt the password used to remote into the virtual machine.

Be sure to save the .pem file in a secure folder. Right-click the file to open its Properties, and from the Security tab, click Advanced then the Disable inheritance button (it should appear as "Enable inheritance").

Lastly, remove *SYSTEM* and *Everyone* from it, and ensure only the accounts of users you want to use the file are left listed with *Read* only access.

Because it is common for malicious parties to find and take advantage of idle EC2 and other AWS resources, it is best to restrict the *Network settings* for the EC2 instance as much as possible. Here I am making the instance only accessible from my IP address.

**Note:** If your IP address dynamically changes, you will need to modify your Instance's Security Group (found under the Security tab) to edit the IP address on the Inbound Rule to match your own. As tedious as this may be, it is more secure than leaving it open to a wider IP address range.

## Step 3. Remote desktop into the virtual machine and configure it for application installations

Right-click your instance and select Connect.

![AWS EC2 Instance connection Part 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2022-08-06--11.png?raw=true)

Navigate to the *RDP client* tab, and click the *Download remote desktop file* to save a copy of the RDP connection locally.

Click the *Get password* button, and you will be prompted to upload the .pem file downloaded earlier to decrypt the password needed to log into the .rdp connection you just downloaded.

![AWS EC2 Instance connection Part 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2022-08-06--12.png?raw=true)

Using the .rdp connection and the password, remote into your new Windows instance.

Windows Server 2019 only comes with Internet Explorer for a browser, which has strict settings that make it difficult to upgrade to other browsers like Microsoft Edge, and to download and install applcations like Visual Studio Code.

Open Internet Explorer, and adjust the Internet Options to allow *File download* and *Active scripting*.

## Step 4. Install Visual Studio Code, Python Extensions, and set up your project

Download and install Python for Windows (be sure to add it to the PATH variable, and in my case I installed it for all users):

* **[https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)**

Download and install Visual Studio Code, and install the Python extensions:

* **[https://code.visualstudio.com/Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)**

Create a new folder for your project and open it in Visual Studio Code, then create a virtual environment for Python, and install relevant Python modules. For details on how to set this up, see Step 1 from a previous blog post: 

* **[https://datamesse.github.io/#/post/1650117600](https://datamesse.github.io/#/post/1650117600)**

At this point, you can create an image of your EC2 instance so you don't have to go through the same set up when creating new instances, but as this may incur additional costs, I won't be doing that here.

## Step 5. Create your web-scraping project




**Important!** Remember to stop the Instance to prevent unnecessary charges, or Terminate it altogther to get rid of it (costs are still incurred from whe it was running).
