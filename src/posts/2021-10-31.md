This is a sample dataset created using Excel randomisation, and you can create your own using the file generator.

You can download or connect to the sample dataset from **[here](https://github.com/datamesse/data-visualisation-datasets/blob/main/Support%20ticket%20updates/Support%20ticket%20updates.xlsx?raw=true)**.

The Github repository with the agent photos can be found **[here](https://github.com/datamesse/data-visualisation-datasets/tree/main/Support%20ticket%20updates/agents)**.

An Excel random person name and business generator was also used to create this dataset, downloadable **[here](https://github.com/datamesse/data-visualisation-datasets/blob/main/Support%20ticket%20updates/Random%20name%20and%20business%20generator.xlsx?raw=true)**.

The dataset contains:
 - 5000 support tickets
 - 27780 support ticket update records
 - 29 agents across 8 countries and 12 cities
 - 1233 end users across 27 countries and 65 cities
 - Date/timestamps are based on Sydney, Australia time (AEST GMT+10/AEDT GMT+11)

The first worksheet "Updates" has the back-and-forth update records for each ticket, indicating if the update is a public user message or agent reply, or an internal message by an Agent.

The second worksheet "Assignment" has the ticket created versus ticket assigned date/time data.

**Why this dataset was created?**

Working in a global support team providing follow-the-sun (FTS) customer service, I wanted to be able to visualise the teamwork across staff members.

As I needed a fake dataset to test ideas on, I created an Excel file that randomly generated support ticket update information (e.g. when a end-user opens a ticket, when an agent first replies to the end-user, and the back-and-forth until the ticket becomes solved). The columns used in the dataset are meant to be similar to those seen in CRM systems that provide reporting on such ticket updates (e.g. Zendesk).

I noticed my random generator did not account for the ticket IDs being in a realistic sequence, which needs to be amended after extracting the data from the generator. Also, the generator is limited in providing "follow-the-sun" support update records, so I spent some time manually editing records to demonstrate this in the sample dataset.
