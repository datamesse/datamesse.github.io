This post covers my approach to improving my site from version 3 (deployed December 2022) to version 4 (deployed July 2023), by going through several key **basic** CSS lessons whilst redesigning it from scratch. Please note this is a reflective post and not intended as a "best practice" one.


##  Context

My website's 3rd version catered for mobile portrait and small to medium-sized landscape monitors. You can find a copy of Version 3 at **[archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20221126031933/https://datamesse.github.io/#/)**.

This is how it looked at 1920 x 1080 resolution using Microsoft Edge's Developer Tools. I assumed this would be the standard resolution for most corporate monitors, based on my browsing of **[Dell's website](https://www.dell.com/en-au/shop/computer-monitors/ar/8605)**.

![Site version 3 at 1920 x 1080](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--01.png?raw=true)

This is how it looked from an iPhone 14t 430 x 932 resolution.

![Site version 3 at 430 x 932](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--02.png?raw=true)

Several months later, I realised it might be viewed at much larger screen resolutions. I found one of the largest monitors on Dell's site, the "_Dell UltraSharp 32 6K Monitor - U3224KB_" at 6144 x 3456 resolution, and my site did not cater for this at all. Text did not scale and was illegible, and elements were awkwardly disproportionate from each other.

##  Goal

My website serves as a journal to share my works. I've had the fortunate and fun experience of meeting people, and showing them my website via my phone. So, I decided to take a mobile-first approach to my site's design, with the desktop design being as close to the mobile design as possible. This was for 2 reasons:

* Familiarity; What I show people in person, they would easily recognise if they checked again later via desktop.

* Code management; Minimal additions to the CSS code base are needed to make it viable for desktop.

![Site version 4 outline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--04.png?raw=true)

I decided to redo the entire CSS design from scratch, intending for the final code to be more thorough and easier to follow, rather than a patchwork approach that leads to confusion in later development.

The first problem to address was to ensure regardless of resolution and orientation, the new site had a...


##  Responsive layout

2 areas need to be covered.

* Resolution - The general layout changes appropriately for portrait, landscape, and everything in between.
* Scaling - Design elements and text scale in a balanced way with viewport changes. 

I had to decide on the breakpoint for switching between portrait to landscape.

A square viewport would not be a suitable breakpoint because there is insufficient width for the interface and background to be similar proportions as the landscape design. A square viewport looks better with the portrait design (for smaller resolutions, at least).

![Site version 4 square design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--05.png?raw=true)

The question becomes how much wider would the width need to be for the breakpoint to switch from portrait to landscape design. Through experimentation, I decided on a 3:2 ratio.

![Site version 4 3:2 ratio design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--06.png?raw=true)

Next, we create the 3 main divs for the layout using...


### Grid layout + z-indexing

This was my first use of grid layout to position and z-index to overlay div components, as I previously used the position absolute property.

#### HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head><link rel="stylesheet" href="Layout.css"></head>

    <body>

        <div class='container'>

            <div class="interface">

                <center id="replace this entire div with your content">
                    <br /><br /><br />
                    <h1>INTERFACE</h1>
                    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
                    <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
                </center>

            </div>

            <div class="background">
            
                <br />
                <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>

            </div>

        </div>

    </body>
</html>
```

#### CSS

```
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Saira:wght@600&display=swap');

html { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; font-family: 'Saira' }
body { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; }
div { margin: 0px; padding: 0px; }

::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }

.container {
    width: 100vw; height: 100vh;
    background-color: #C00000;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr;
    z-index: 1;
}

.interface {
    background-color: #92CDDC;
    height: max-content;
    grid-row-start: 1;
    grid-row-end: 2;
    z-index: 3;
}

.background {
    background-color: #FFD965;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 2;
}

/* PORTRAIT */
@media (max-aspect-ratio: 3/2) {

    .interface {
        width: 100vw;
        grid-column-start: 1;
        grid-column-end: 2;
    }

}

/* LANDSCAPE */
@media (min-aspect-ratio: 3/2) {

    .interface {
        width: 40vw;
        grid-column-start: 2;
        grid-column-end: 3;
    }

}
```

![CSS code result - vertical](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--07.png?raw=true)

![CSS code result - horizontal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--08.png?raw=true)

Key notes on the above code are:

* The removal of scrollbars to make the visual design a bit cleaner and seem more like an app rather than a website.

```
::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none; }
```

* The interface element's height is determined by its content. This allows it to scroll vertically whilst the background stays fixed.


### Vertical carousel for portfolio and blog pages

I used this YouTube video [How to make horizontal scroll item - CSS Tricks by Laravel Article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_E5uoiLCLY) as a guide to help me create a vertical carousel design for my portfolio and blog components (rather than a horizontal one which felt less natural to navigate).


#### HTML

```
<div class='carousel'>

    <div class='blurb'>
        In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army.
    </div>

    <div class='blurb'>
        Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out.
    </div>

    <div class='blurb'>
        On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.
    </div>

    <div class='blurb'>
        I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.
    </div>

</div>
```

#### CSS

```
.carousel {
  width: inherit;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.blurb {
  height: 25vh;
  width: inherit;
  margin-bottom: 5vh;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 2px solid black;
  background-color: aqua;
}
```

## Animated elements


### Looping background

My profile page loops an image horizontally, giving the impression of passing along an infinite beach.

![CSS looping background - browser rendered](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--10.png?raw=true)

The background image's height is set to the viewport's height and its width set to "auto" in order to scale the image evenly. The image is repeated along the x-axis and the whole "train" of horizontally-lined images are moved horizontally using keyframes to give the looping effect.

![CSS looping background - conceptual diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--11.png?raw=true)

Optionally, background-position is used to define how the initial image is positioned onscreen on the initial render.

#### CSS

```
.background {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    position: fixed;
    z-index: 2;
    background-size: auto 100vh;
    background-repeat: repeat-x;
    background-position: -450vw 0vh;
    background-image: url("https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/blob/main/src/assets-theme/background-panorama-beach.png?raw=true");
    animation: bg-auto-scrolling 1800.32s infinite;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
}

@keyframes bg-auto-scrolling {
    100% { background-position: 3000vw 0vh; }
}
```

Note: Different animation times are defined for the portrait and landscape views to ensure a consistent feel across both on my actual website. I didn't do that here for ease of your reading.

A similar concept is applied to the portfolio and blog pages, where a small transparent tile is repeated all over the screen, and as a collective are "looped".


### Spinning gear

On both the portfolio and blog pages, there are spinning gears as part of the background. The images for these were sourced from Pixbay and created by TheDigitalArtist.

* **[https://pixabay.com/vectors/cyber-tech-circle-rings-pattern-7153617/](https://pixabay.com/vectors/cyber-tech-circle-rings-pattern-7153617/)**

I edited the SVGs using a text editor to change their original colour from black to blue, and reduced their opacity.

#### SVG

```
<svg fill:#00B0FF;fill-opacity:0.42;stroke:#00B0FF;stroke-opacity:1;
```

They now look like this.

![Edited gear images on GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--12.png?raw=true)

#### HTML

```
    <div class="background">
        <div class="gear1 spin-gear"></div>
        <div class="gear2 spin-gear"></div>
    </div>
```

#### CSS

```
.gear1 {
    position: absolute;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-image: url("https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/raw/main/src/assets-theme/background-gear-blue-7147602.svg");
    z-index: 3;
    top: -20vh;
    left: -10vh;
    width: 120vh;
    height: 120vh;
}

.gear2 {
    position: absolute;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-image: url("https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/raw/main/src/assets-theme/background-gear-blue-7153617.svg");
    z-index: 3;
    top: -8vh;
    left: 2vh;
    width: 96vh;
    height: 96vh;
}

.spin-gear {
    animation-name: spinning;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation-duration: 56.32s;
}

@keyframes spinning {
    from { transform: rotate(360deg); }
    to { transform: rotate(0deg); }
}
```

### Buttons resizing when hovered over

My buttons are multiple div elements housed in a single 1 x 1 grid container div, using z-index to layer them.

Then the continer div is set to scale all its nested elements when the cursor hovers over it.

#### HTML

```
    <div class="interface">

        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

        <div class="button-container">
            <a href='/' target='_blank'>
                <img src="https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/blob/main/src/assets-theme/logo-github.png?raw=true" />
            </a>
            <div class="button-inner-colour"></div>
        </div>

        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
        <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

    </div>
```

#### CSS

```
.button-container {
    width: 20vw;
    height: 20vw;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 100%;
    grid-template-columns: 100%;
    background-color: black;
    z-index: 10;
}

.button-inner-colour {
    margin: auto;
    width: 19vw;
    height: 19vw;
    grid-row-start: 1; grid-row-end: 2;
    grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 2;
    background-color: white;
    z-index: 11;
}

.button-container a { 
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    width: inherit;
    height: inherit;
    text-decoration: none;
    grid-row-start: 1; grid-row-end: 2;
    grid-column-start: 1; grid-column-end: 2;
    z-index: 12;
}

.button-container a img { width: 18vw; height: 18vw; margin: 1vw; }

.button-container:hover { transform: scale(0.85); }
```

## Sound effects and music


### Playing a sound effect when a button is clicked

For important buttons on my site, I applied a sound effect on-click as a novelty, being careful not to do so for every button in order to prevent it from becoming too bothersome for the end user.

The embedded JavaScript approach I took is definitely not best practice, as ideally you would want to somehow ensure the sound effect asset file is loaded into the session before putting it to use, to avoid a disconnect between the user clicking the button and the sound playing. In my case, the sound files seem small enough that occasional disconnect should be fine.

The sound file in the code below can be found at **[https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)**.

#### HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="Layout.css">
        <script>
            let soundEffect = new Audio('https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/raw/main/src/assets-theme/mixkit-technology-notification-3123.wav');
            function start() {
                soundEffect.play();
            };
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class='container'>
            <div class="interface">
                <div class="button-container">
                    <a href='/' target='_blank' onClick="start()">
                        <img src="https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/blob/main/src/assets-theme/logo-github.png?raw=true" />
                    </a>
                    <div class="button-inner-colour"></div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="background"></div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```


### Background music

For each major page of my site, I used the audio tag to embed different background music, and applied JavaScript to preset the music's volume to 20% so it plays subtly.

The music file in the code below was created by Evgeny_Bardyuzha from Pixabay **[https://pixabay.com/users/evgeny_bardyuzha-25235210/](https://pixabay.com/users/evgeny_bardyuzha-25235210/)**.

#### HTML

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="Layout.css">
        <script>
            window.onload = function() {
                let audioPlayer = document.getElementById('audioPlayer');
                audioPlayer.volume = 0.2;
            };
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class='container'>
            <div class="interface">
                <audio id="audioPlayer" src="https://github.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/raw/main/src/assets-theme/music-evgeny-bardyuzha-good-mood-for-no-reason.mp3" controls autoplay loop></audio>
            </div>
            <div class="background"></div>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

In the example code above, I left in the controls attribute of the audio tag so it is obvious how an audio player element is embedded into the site.

![Audio player in HTML](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--15.png?raw=true)

In my actual site, I removed that attribute and instead created a custom design element of moving music bars.



## Scalable images

Lastly, my favourite site for creating and editing scalable vector graphics (SVGs) at the time of writing this blog post, is Boxy SVG **[https://boxy-svg.com/app/](https://boxy-svg.com/app/)**. In the screenshot below I created the lanyard tag for my profile page's photo by converting a PNG to an SVG which wasn't quite clean enough, then used Boxy SVG to tweak my SVG's anchor points to make its code smaller and more efficient.

![Boxy SVG example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2023-10-07--16.png?raw=true)



The revamp of my site came about mostly with the help of **[Bing Chat with GPT-4](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1)** to figure out the approach and code for the bells and whistles I've added, and I am quite happy with how I've upgraded the visual design over its past versions.
