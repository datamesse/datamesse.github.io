How to use Power Query to find the aggregate value for rows grouped by a column value in Power BI.

T-SQL uses the concept of window functions to perform aggregations across groupings of rows, which are based on a specific column's values. More info on this can be found on [Pinal Dave's blog](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2015/05/28/sql-server-what-are-t-sql-window-functions-notes-from-the-field-082/).

```
Table.NestedJoin(#"Previous step in your Power Query code", 
                 {"Column(s) for left side of the join"}, 
                Table.Group(#"Previous step in your Power Query code", 
                             {"Column(s) to group by"}, 
                             {{"New column name for the aggregation result", 
                             each List.Min([#"Column to apply aggregation on"]), 
                             type nullable datatypeofyouraggregation}}),
                 {"Column(s) for right side of the join"}, 
                 "New merged group by table name",
                 JoinKind.Inner)
```

As a basic example, say your dataset has rows representing quarterly sales and you need to calculate the proportion of sales which quarter represents for the whole year i.e. Quarterly Sales รท Annual Sales.

You can do this by using a preliminary window function to first calculate annual sales by summing the rows based on shared year column values, providing that same value for each row of the group. Then for each row, calculate the proportion from there.

![Example concept of Window function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--01.png?raw=true)

The equivalent of Window functions in Power BI would typically be used for quantitative measures, and are thus more likely to be implemented using DAX calculations.

However, there can be scenarios where window functions need to employed in a more categorical nature. Going by the general principle that custom measures (i.e. quantitative calculations) should be done in DAX, and that custom columns (typically categorical) should be done in Power Query, the latter is what we will employ here.

In this example scenario's dataset, we have 5 unique support ticket numbers, with each row representing an instance where a support agent has sent a response to the end-user for a ticket, as indicated by the date/timestamp.

![Example categorical scenario of support ticket response date/timestamps](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--02.png?raw=true)

Our objective is to create a column that identifies which rows of data represent the "first response" to the end-user for each ticket, with that intended 1st response flag being a rudimentary marker to help calculate other support agent statistics we may want (e.g. proportion of support tickets where the 1st responder is the assignee).

This is the equivalent of the previous example's proportion of annual sales that quarterly sales represents, in that the creation of a preliminary window function is needed. In our scenario, instead of doing a sum of sales based on rows sharing the same year, we will get the minimum (and hence the first) date/timestamps based on rows sharing the same ticket number.

The approach taken here is to create a new column whose definition is the combination of two common queries:
1. The Table.NestedJoin function that's commonly seen in *Merge Queries* to combine your existing dataset to the conceptual grouped dataset.
2. The Table.Group function creates a conceptual grouped by table of the existing dataset with the desired aggregate result, and that conceptual table being passed as the right-joined table parameter into the Table.NestedJoin.
3. Then expand the merged table to display the aggregate result for each row of the original dataset.

**Code structure**

```
Table.NestedJoin(#"Previous step in your Power Query code", 
                 {"Column(s) for left side of the join"}, 
                Table.Group(#"Previous step in your Power Query code", 
                             {"Column(s) to group by"}, 
                             {{"New column name for the aggregation result", 
                             each List.Min([#"Column to apply aggregation on"]), 
                             type nullable datatypeofyouraggregation}}),
                 {"Column(s) for right side of the join"}, 
                 "New merged group by table name",
                 JoinKind.Inner)
```

**Example**

Applying the code structure above, the M code would be as below:

![M code with merged](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--03.png?raw=true)

```
    #"Added Custom" = Table.NestedJoin(#"Changed Type", 
                                       {"Ticket ID"},
                                       Table.Group(#"Changed Type",
                                                   {"Ticket ID"},
                                                   {{"1st response",
                                                   each List.Min([#"Update - Timestamp"]), type nullable datetime}}),
                                       {"Ticket ID"},
                                       "Merged group by table",
                                       JoinKind.Inner)
```

The result of the new column addition (which is a merged table), will appear as below.

Then you simply need to expand out the aggregate column from the merge.

![Power Query expand merged Group By table to display the aggregate column 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--05.png?raw=true)

![Power Query expand merged Group By table to display the aggregate column 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--06.png?raw=true)

Now that the preliminary window function is complete, we can address the example objective of creating a custom column to indicate which data row per Ticket ID represents the first support agent response to an end-user, which is a simple if condition to compare the "Update - Timestamp" and "1st response" columns.

![Power Query if condition for example custom column](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--07.png?raw=true)

![Power Query final example custom column](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datamesse/datamesse.github.io/main/src/assets-blog/2021-10-17--08.png?raw=true)

In this way, regardless of how the data is sorted in Power Query, the records representing the 1st responses will remain.
